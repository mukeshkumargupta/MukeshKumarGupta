### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

These are the area where I have worked. Please find project poc demo which I created before working on actual projects. 
### Projects Demo

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/java-j2ee-projects-demo/tree/master/design-online-shopping-cart
This is an online shopping project using SpringMVC, Hibernate, Maven, Angular JS and ###Bootstrap. This project is done Step By Step. For more in details refer link: https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/java-j2ee-tutorials/blob/master/design-online-shopping-cart/Project_Steps.txt.

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/java-j2ee-projects-demo/tree/master/design-users-profile-using-rest-apis-with-jax-rs
Under this project advance concept of ###REST are tried to used. user will able to submit his profile. Any user can send message to other user. Any user can comment on message(May be in future Like Vs Dislike on message as well as on comments can be implemented). Here Profile post/get/delete, message post/get/delete and comment post/get and delete are handled using REST API. For more details please refer the project.

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/java-j2ee-projects-demo/tree/master/spring-boot-kafka-example-master Using Spring boot, kafka producer and consumer is created. How to produce messages from command line and consume those messages from kafka consumer using spring boot and vice versa. Most of things are covered to start kafka based project using spring boot. To get details on code level, please refer the project link.

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/java-j2ee-projects-demo/tree/master/spring-boot-microservices-workshop-master
If you want to create your own microservice using spring boot. You may refer this project. There are three microservices i.e. movie catalog service, 
movie info service and ratings data service are created to explain the things. Please refer  project link to know how each service interact with each other.

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/java-j2ee-projects-demo/tree/master/spring-cloud-stream-example-master Using this project demo, it is explained how to use spring cloud stream. Here like any messaging queue service you can easily change like Kafka or RabbitMQ by changing configuration, there is no need to change of major code if you decided to change your messaging queue service.

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/java-j2ee-projects-demo/tree/master/java-interview-questions-answers Here all Java fundamentals are explained.

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/data-structure-algorithms-java-tutorials/tree/master/src/com/interview/systemdesign
There are many standard problems which we need to know, I tried to document those standard industry system design practice which are required when you are going to design and architech project.

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/data-structure-algorithms-java-tutorials/tree/master/src/com/interview/designpatterns
There are many stand design patterns. There are 22+ design pattern. Knowing which design pattern will be effective for use case problem. I tried to address by giving example Java code for most of the design patterns. 

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/data-structure-algorithms-java-tutorials
Knowing all algorithms and writting code for each are dificult so I tried to solve as much as problem and make library of those algorithms which can be directly used in project usecase. Still many are missing but I tried to cover as much as possible. It is also true that, I am not getting much time of solving problem rather focusing most of our time on system design. It is keep on going.... . lets see how much I can be up to date on this part.

https://github.com/mukeshkumargupta/python-ml-projects-demo Here I tried to learn python by using ML. Thisd is how I learn any language by doing project. I have hands on experince. I did a lot but not got much time to document those things. Just basic I tried to document things here. I will update once I will get time.
